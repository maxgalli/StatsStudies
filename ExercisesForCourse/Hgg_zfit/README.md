# $H \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ Parametric Fitting

In this exercise we will look at one of the most famous parametric fitting analyses at the LHC: the Higgs boson decaying to two photons (H → γ γ). This decay channel is key in understanding the properties of the Higgs boson due to its clean final state topology. The excellent energy resolution- of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter leads to narrow signal peak in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum, $m_{\gamma\gamma}$, above a smoothly falling background continuum. The mass spectrum for the legacy Run 2 analysis is shown below.
