The purpose of the session is to approach the discovery of a \"new\" particle in the context of the observation of the ψ(2S) resonance in the CMS data.\n",

The difference bitween the two is that ```DataSet_lowstat.pkl``` corresponds to about 20\\% of the statistics available in 2010, while ```DataSet.pkl``` contains the full statistics. You will be asked to use the low statistics sample in tasks 0, 1 and the full statistics sample in tasks 2, 3. "

    "- the observable can be fit in a range of [2, 6] GeV\n",
    "- to model the J/ψ peak you can use a Crystal Ball distribution with the following values for the parameters (starting value, [low limit, high limit]): mean (3.1, [2.8, 3.4]), sigma (0.3, [0.0001, 1]), alpha (1.5, [-5, 5]), n (1.5, [0.5, 10])\n",
    "- to model the ψ(2S) peak you can use anothe Crystal Ball distribution with the following values for the parameters: mean (3.7, [2.5, 3.95]) and sigma, alpha, n like the J/ψ\n",
    "- to model the background you can use a Chebychev polynomal of order 3, with the first three coefficients having the followin values: a1 (-0.7, [-2, 2]), a2 (0.3, [-2, 2]), a3 (-0.03, [-2, 2])\n",

    "For each of these components, you then need to define a parameter to describe the yield (number of events). Note that since our **Parameter of Interest** is the ψ(2S) **cross section**, rather than the simple number of events, it is convenient to define the latter as a function of the former:\n",

    "- J/ψ yield (1500, [0, 10000])\n",
