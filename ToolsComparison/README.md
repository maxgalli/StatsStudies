# Tools Comparison

This part aims to investigate alternatives to Combine, by setting up comparisons mostly with ZFit and Pyhf.

## Set up
Since Combine doesn't support Python3, we have to use Python2. Conda can be used, hence we follow the instructions reported [here](https://github.com/maxgalli/StatsStudies.git); we won't be able to use CombineTool but it shouldn't be a big deal for this kind of studies.
